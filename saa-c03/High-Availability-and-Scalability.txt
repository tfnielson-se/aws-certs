- [ ] High Availability and Scalability: ELB & ASG
    Scalability
        - Vertical
            + Increase size of an instance
            + Ex: scaling from t2.micro to t2.large
            + Common for non distruibuted systems, such as database
            + RDS, ElastiCache are services that scale vertically
            + Theres usually a limit to how much can you vertically scale (hardware limit)

        - Horizontal ( = elasticity )
            + Increase the number of instances for your app
            + Implies scaling distributed systems
            + Common for web apps / modern applications
            + It'easy to  scale because of cloud
            + Scale In: decrease the number of instances
            + Scale Out: increase the number of instances
    High Availability
        Run instances of the same application across multi AZ
        The goal of high availability is to survive a data center loss

- [ ] ELB = Elastic Load Balancing
    Evenly distribute users to available EC2 Instances
    Types:
        - Application Load Balancer (ALB)
        - Network Load Balancer (NLB)
        - Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)

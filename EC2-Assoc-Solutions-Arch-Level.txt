EC2 Assoc. Solutions Architect Level
- [ ] IPs
	Public vs IPv4 vs IPv6
	IPv4 most common

- [ ] Elastic IPs
	Stop and Start EC2 Instance can change IP address
	If you have a fixed public IP for your instance you need an Elastic IP
	Elastic IP is a public IPv4 IP you own as long as you don’t delete it
	Allows you to mask failures by rapidly remapping the address to another instance
	You can only have 5 Elastic IPs in your account (you can ask AWS to increase)
	Avoid using Elastic IP
		-reflects poor architectural decisions
		-instead, use a random IP and register a DNS name to it

- [ ]  Placement Groups
	Instance placement strategy using placement groups
	Strategies:
		-  Cluster: clusters instances into a low-latency group in a single Availability Zone (AZ) [same hardware, same rack]
			+ Pros: Great network
			- Cons: If rack fails, all instances fails at the same time
			+- Use Case: Big Data Job that needs fast completion. App that needs low latency and high network throughput

		- Spread: spreads instances across underlying hardware (max 7 instances per AZ) [instances in diff. hardware]
			+ Pros: span across AZ. Reduce Risk of simultaneous failure.
			- Cons: Limited to 7 instances per AZ per Placement Group
			+- Use Case: App that needs to maximize high availability. Critical App where each instance must be isolated from failure from each other

		- Partition: spreads instances across many different partitions (which rely on different sets of racks) within an AZ. Scales to 100s of EC2 Instances per group (Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka)
			+ Pros:
				-Up to 7 partitions per AZ
				-Can span across multiple AZs in the same region
				-The instances in a partition do not share racks with the instances in other partitions
				-A partition failure can affect many EC2 but won’t affect other partitions
				-EC2 Instances get access to the partitions information as metadata
			+- Use Case: Big Data App (HDFS, HBase, Cassandra, Kafka)

- [ ] Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)
	Gives EC2 instances access to network
	logic component in a VPC that represents virtual network card
	ENI Attributes:
		- (1) Primary Private IPv4, one or more secondary IPv4
		- (1) Elastic IPv4 per private IPv4
		- (1) Public IPv4
		- One or more security groups
		- A MAC Address
	You can create EIN independently and attach them on the fly (move them) on EC2 Instances for failover
	Bound to a specific AZ
	More Control over IPv4 & networking

- [ ] EC2 Hibernate
	In memory (RAM) state is preserved
	The instance boot is much faster!
	Under the hood: the RAM state is written to a file in the root EBS volume
	The root EBS volume must be encrypted
	Use Cases:
		- Long-running processing
		- Saving the RAM state
		- Services that take time to initialize
	Good to knows:
		Supported Instance Families - C3, C4, C5. I3, M3, M4. R3, R4, T2, T3, …
		Instance RAM Size: less than 150GB
		Root Volume: must be EBS, encrypted, not instance store, and large
		Available for On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot Instances
		CAN NOT be hibernated for more than 60 days
